# Sorry. Not much to show. 
### I spent all of today: forking, configuring, and making 2 different Python®s from source. Also, a side quest to install NVIDIA DIGITS®, which, 1: Doesn't work on this OS, 2: Doesn't work on this architecture, 3: Doesn't even WORK anymore due to nvida®-docker getting deprecated, 4: Would not have helped my situation, and many other reasons.
# The work for today is minimal, but do not underestimate me.
# Anyway, cya! <3
